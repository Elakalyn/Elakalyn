### Welcome to my profile! üëã

Thanks for stopping by! My name is Omar Elakaly. I'm an ambitious developer and digital creator with a passion for producing charming, intuitive and engaging experiences. As a perfectionist, I'm committed to crafting unique experiences and challenging the limits of what's achieveable to create something truly exceptional and one of a kind. In addition to having a vigorous work ethic, I also appreciate all opportunities to work collaboratively with others to bring new and creative ideas to life. I'm a lifelong learner and continually strive to stay up to date with the latest technologies and trends. My goal is to make a long lasting impact through the work I produce.  


### Technologies I work with üë®‚Äçüíª

I am currently working with the Flutter framework and utilizing the Firebase platform as a backend for my projects as I believe that this combination of tools is extremely powerful and allows me to create my projects quickly and efficiently. I enjoy designing my own UI interfaces and prototypes mostly through Figma. I personally use Visual Studio Code as my main IDE.
