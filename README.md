Technologies I work with üë®‚Äçüíª
</h2>
I am currently working with the Flutter framework and utilizing the Firebase platform as a backend for my projects as I believe that this combination of tools is extremely powerful and allows me to create my projects quickly and efficiently. I enjoy designing my own UI interfaces and prototypes mostly through Figma. I personally use Visual Studio Code as my main IDE.

### Core Values

My personal values are centered around perfection, excellence, and making a positive impact on the world. I am dedicated to producing work that helps us advance as a civilization and contributes to a better future for all. I firmly believe in abstaining from projects or activities that thrive off of negativity, exploitation, or harm to others or violate the basic principles of respect, inclusion, and compassion. In all my interactions, I prioritize honesty, transparency, and authenticity as I believe these qualities are essential for building trust and creating meaningful connections.
